![0703284532324-web-tete](https://github.com/AlJawharhALOtaibi/Personalized_Recommendations_with_IBM/assets/87391133/cef46617-9302-47df-96bf-be0eb94e8179)

This project aims to analyze user interactions with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and provide recommendations to users based on their preferences. By leveraging various data analysis techniques and recommendation systems, we intend to offer personalized article suggestions to enhance user experience.

Motivation:
The primary focus of this project is to examine user-article interactions within the IBM Watson Studio platform. Through a comprehensive study of available data, we aim to derive insights that can drive effective article recommendations.

Tools and Libraries:
The project requires Python 3.7 or higher along with essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pickle, Regular Expressions (re), NLTK, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter for data analysis and modeling.

Data Description:
The project utilizes two key .csv files:
1. user-item-interactions.csv: Captures interactions between users and articles.
2. articles_community.csv: Contains information regarding the articles available on the platform.

Project Sections:

I. Exploratory Data Analysis:
Before delving into recommendation systems, an exploratory analysis of the available data is essential. This phase involves uncovering patterns, statistics, and gaining an overall understanding of the dataset. Key questions about the data will be addressed to inform subsequent steps.

II. Rank Based Recommendations:
The initial recommendation approach involves identifying the most popular articles based on interaction counts. Articles with higher interactions will be recommended to new users or those with limited user information.

III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering:
To enhance recommendations, a user-user collaborative filtering technique will be implemented. This method focuses on identifying users with similar article interaction patterns, suggesting articles based on their similarities.

IV. Content-Based Recommendations:
Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, a content-based recommendation system will be explored. This system analyzes article content to recommend articles based on their textual features, providing diverse recommendation approaches.

V. Matrix Factorization:
A machine learning approach using matrix decomposition will be employed to predict user-article interactions. This technique aims to understand the prediction accuracy for new article recommendations based on user-item interactions.

Conclusion and Future Steps:
The project will conclude with a discussion on the effectiveness of the implemented methods and recommendations. Additionally, potential avenues for testing recommendation performance and optimizing user engagement will be explored for future iterations.
